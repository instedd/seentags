Seentags
========

Seentags is a service -developed by [InSTEDD](http://instedd.org)- that helps extract accurate information from text
reports.

What is it?
-----------
Many people want to report data via text message, Twitter and other short messaging channels, but users find it hard to remember and accurately type information consistently in the same way every time.  People have a hard time following rigid syntax structures because it's not how they intuitively think.  Seentags eliminates the need to use complex or consistent reporting structures in order to have the message understood.  With Seentags, incoming text message reports can be deciphered without setting up any initial reporting structure.

How does it work?
-----------------
Seentags accepts incoming text messages and breaks the contents up into categories, without requiring you to tell the system in advance what your categories are.  Once the information is in the Seentags system, the user can provide feedback to ‘train’ Seentags so that it learns to correctly interpret new report formats.  With a built in pattern detector, you only need to tell the system what category the text is one time before it does it automatically with all future messages as well as correcting all previous entries.  Text separators such as commas, dashes or periods are no longer needed in order to define, categorize and organize incoming information. Seentags automatically puts your data into a CSV file that you can then export for your future needs.
